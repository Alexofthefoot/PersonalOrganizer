# Personal Organizer

This project began as a simple bullet journal companion but has since grown into a versatile, multifaceted tool. It is designed not only to keep track different areas of my daily life but also to serve as a portfolio piece to showcase my skills to future employers.

**Project Status:**  
*Project is currently on hold in its current form due to budget constraints.*  
I started developing this project with the goal of creating an online tool. However, due to the ongoing costs of cloud hosting I was unable to fully implement the intended features. I plan to revisit the project in the future, transitioning it to a local format rather than a cloud-hosted solution. This will allow me to continue developing the functionality at a lower cost. In the meantime, the work completed so far showcases my growing experience with front-end development, and I look forward to revisiting it when I have more time and resources.

## Features
The application is a central hub for:

- Clothing Tracking: Manage a physical wardrobe, including records of cost-per-wear over time and the location of garments across multiple homes.
- Tarot Readings: Log readings, analyze patterns, and keep track of insights gained from tarot practice.
- Goal Setting & Progress Tracking: Work towards personal and professional goals while monitoring your progress.

## Learning Objectives
This project has been a valuable learning experience, particularly in:

- Front-End Development: Most of my academic background focused on small-scale backend projects and hypothetical situations. Developing this application has allowed me to expand my front-end skills significantly.
- Full-Stack Integration: By combining backend knowledge with new front-end tools, Iâ€™ve created a fully functional application.
- UI/UX Design: Learning how to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface has been both challenging and rewarding.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MySQL 
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Next Steps
Planned future features include:

- Enhancements to the tarot-reading functionality, such as visual representations of spreads.
- Improved wardrobe analytics to make outfit suggestions.
- Goal tracking dashboards with graphs and charts to track goal progress.

## Why This Project?
This application reflects my passion for staying personal organizationa and efficiency, as well as my continuous desire to learn and improve. It also demonstrates my ability to build practical tools that solve real-world problems while showcasing my growing skill set in software development.
